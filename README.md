# Smart Tenant Management

A **Smart Tenant Management** system is a software application that helps landlords and property managers manage their rental properties and tenants. It simplifies the process of managing rental properties by automating tasks such as:
- Managing rental records
- Maintenance requests
- Lease renewals

The system can also help tenants by providing them with an easy way to submit maintenance requests, communicate with their landlord or property manager, and also pay rent which will be implemented later.
